<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In short, the goal of this course is to introduce students to ways of
thinking about how Artificial Intelligence will and has impacted
humans, and how we can design interactive intelligent systems that are
usable and beneficial to humans, and respect human values. As students
in this course, you will build a number of different interactive
technologies powered by AI, gain practical experience with what
impacts their usability for humans, understand the various places that
humans exist in the data pipeline that drives machine learning, and
learn to think both optimistically and critically of what AI systems
can do and how they can and should be integrated into society.</p>

  substring "HAII Course" to begin a meaningful subject line and have
  tried to resolve the issue appropriately otherwise. For example, you
  should post questions about course material and homework assignments
  on Canvas first, and then use emails only after an appropriate
  amount of time has passed without a response. Please use your CMU

</ul>
<h2 id="late-assignments-and-attendance-policy">Late Assignments and Attendance Policy</h2>
<p>Attending class in person and submitting course deliverables on time is critical. However, we realize that things happen, and that you might sometimes not be able to turn in your assignments. To accommodate this, you will each receive <strong>5 free late days</strong>.</p>
<p>Beyond those days, you receive a 5% penalty for each day late.  You are welcome to budget late days as you like, for instance 3 free day late for one assignment, 2 for another, or all 5 for one.</p>
<p>You cannot use late days for quizzes.</p>
<p>Please do not, under any circumstances, come to class while sick. If you are sick, please stay home and communicate with us.
If you are unable to attend a given class in person, but would like to attend remotely, please email the instructors to receive the remote access to the class. </p>
<h2 id="diversity-statement">Diversity Statement</h2>
<p>It is our goal that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives are well served by this course, that students’ learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity
that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength,
and benefit. Dimensions of diversity include race, age, national
origin, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and
physical ability, sexual orientation, faith and non-faith
perspectives, socio-economic class, political ideology, education,
primary language, family status, military experience, cognitive style,
and communication style. We are intentional in our aim to present
materials and activities that are respectful of diversity, based on
these dimensions and any other visible and invisible differences not
captured in this list. Indeed, in this class you will learn to
approach technology design from an empathetic, human-centered
perspective that directly examines and challenges bias and
inequality. Your suggestions for ensuring that the class lives up to
these values are encouraged and welcomed. In addition, if at any time
you experience or witness anything in this class that challenges
inclusion, is insensitive or othering, or reinforces biases or
stereotypes, please report those experiences using this form
(responses can be anonymous). If you’re uncomfortable sharing with
your instructors, you may voice your concerns to the chair of the HCII
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee, Jodi Forlizzi
<a href="mailto:forlizzi@cmu.edu">(forlizzi@cmu.edu)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="special-accommodations">Special Accommodations</h2>
<p>If you have a disability and have an accommodation letter from the
Disability Resources office, we encourage you to discuss your
accommodations and needs with us as early in the semester as
possible. We will work with you to ensure that accommodations are
provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability
and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with
the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to contact them
at <a href="mailto:access@andrew.cmu.edu">access@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.</p>
<h2 id="health-wellness">Health &amp; Wellness</h2>
<p>Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle
this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol,
getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you
achieve your goals and cope with stress.</p>
<p>All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are
many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of
the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for
support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful.</p>
<p>If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult
life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly
encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services
(CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at
<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/">http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/</a>. Consider
reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help
getting connected to the support that can help.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night:</p>
